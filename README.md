Folder Databases contains the informations about 4534327 trips with Uber during 2014.

The variables we consider are: Date/Time, latitud and longitud. We reference trips according to the day of the week and the time slot (time slots last 3 hours).

For each day of the week and each time slot, we construct 4 clusters thanks to KMeans and indicate them in a map of New-York city. You can see these maps in this dashboard: https://mmatthieu1290-uber-nyc-dashboard-uber-nyc-l0xrkk.streamlit.app/
